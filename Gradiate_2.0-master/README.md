## Tagline
Turn an image into a Gradient

## Requirement Fulfillment
### iOS

4. We integrated Google Cloud Vision API, to extract the dominant colors
### Backend
1. SQLAlchemy is used to create a database for the gradients created by the app
2. The database allows for users to view all of the gradients, to delete any number of gradients at a time, and to add a gradient to the databse 
3. There is also a wrapper that uses Google Cloud Vision API in order to retrieve the top three dominant colors from an image 
4. The API is deployed using Google Cloud
